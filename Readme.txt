Simple application for learning CoreData fundamentals namely FetchRequest, ManagedObjectContext, PresentationMode in SwiftUI.

Files such as StudentView are not relevant to the main Bookworm application, but exist as a reference point for myself. Feel free to remove this and the "Student" and "Item" data entities.
